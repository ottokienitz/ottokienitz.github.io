<ins> Introduction to Comparative Politics </ins>

* Patrick H. O’Neil, Essentials of Comparative Politics, 6th ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 2018), pp. 6-19.

* Jeffrey Kopstein, Mark Lichbach, and Stephen E. Hanson, “What is Comparative Politics?” in Jeffrey Kopstein, Mark Lichbach, and Stephen E. Hanson, eds., Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order, 4th ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014), pp. 1-7, 12-13.*

* Daniel L. Posner, “The Political Salience of Cultural Differences: Why Chewas and Tumbukas Are Allies in Zambia and Adversaries in Malawi,” American Political Science Review 98, 4 (November 2004), pp. 529-545.*

* Lussier, Constraining Elites in Russia and Indonesia, pp. 22-27, 29-39.

_What is comparative politics all about? What is the role of comparison in our thinking in comparative politics— or for that matter in any attempt to make sense of the world around us? How does Posner make use of comparison to understand when cultural cleavages between Chewas and Tumbukas become politically salient and when they do not? What is a “natural experiment,” and how does Posner use one to investigate relations between Chewas and Tumbukas?_

_Each of the theorists we are reading this week presents a distinctive view of who we are and what makes us tick. How would you characterize each theorist’s view? Can you think of contemporary writers or political leaders whose assumptions about human nature and how the world works resemble those of one or more of the writers we are reading this week?_

<ins> Democracy </ins>

* Philippe C. Schmitter and Terry Lynn Karl, “What Democracy Is...and Is Not,” Journal of Democracy 2, 3 (Summer 1991), pp. 75-88.*

* Lussier, Constraining Elites in Russia and Indonesia, pp. 1-11.

* William A. Galston, “The 2016 U.S. Election: The Populist Moment,” Journal of Democracy 28, 2 (April
2017), pp. 21-33.*

* Dickson, The Dictator’s Dilemma, pp. 262-300.

_Consider how the readings inform our conception of what democracy is, how it emerges, whether it can take root anywhere in the world, and how it may be sustained. In the West, we have long taken democracy for granted, assuming that it will never again face serious challenge. The recent rise of political forces whose commitment to democracy is dubious has suddenly upended that assumption. How can we comprehend the challenge to democratic institutions in the West? What brought it on? Think also about the relationship between liberalism (rights) and democracy (rule by the people) that Berman’s piece highlights. Furthermore, in light of Dickson’s chapter, consider how rulers can manipulate conceptions of democracy to suit their own interests in maintaining power._
