How does Posner make use of comparison to understand when cultural cleavages between Chewas and Tumbukas become politically salient and when they do not? What is a “natural experiment,” and how does Posner use one to investigate relations between Chewas and Tumbukas?_

* Dickson, The Dictator’s Dilemma, pp. 262-300.

_Consider how the readings inform our conception of what democracy is, how it emerges, whether it can take root anywhere in the world, and how it may be sustained. In the West, we have long taken democracy for granted, assuming that it will never again face serious challenge. The recent rise of political forces whose commitment to democracy is dubious has suddenly upended that assumption. How can we comprehend the challenge to democratic institutions in the West? What brought it on? Think also about the relationship between liberalism (rights) and democracy (rule by the people) that Berman’s piece highlights. Furthermore, in light of Dickson’s chapter, consider how rulers can manipulate conceptions of democracy to suit their own interests in maintaining power._
