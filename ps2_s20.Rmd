Discussion of the defintion of populism by Bonikowski (2016):

_To ground the discussion, it is useful to begin with a simple definition of populism that captures its most fundamental features. Most scholars would agree with political scientist Cas Mudde that, at its core, populism is a form of politics predicated on the juxtaposition of a corrupt elite with a morally virtuous people.[3] Studies of populism are not concerned with adjudicating whether such moral judgments are accurate, but rather with understanding when this form of politics becomes prevalent, why it is able to garner public support, how it affects existing configurations of political power, and what impact it has on political institutions and policy._

_While a binary moral classification is common to all populist rhetoric, the identities of the vilified elites vary. They frequently include political actors‚Äî either elected representatives or civil servants‚Äîbut also journalists, academics, and business leaders. The boundaries placed around "the people" are often less specific so as to maximize the scope of populist claims. Despite this common vagueness, some varieties of populism exploit antipathies toward particular out- groups, such as ethnic, racial, or religious minorities, by accusing them of having co-opted the elites for their own nefarious ends. The result of such exclusionary discourse is the implicit narrowing of "the people" to a subset of the public that qualifies as the legitimate source of political power. In recent cases of right-wing populism, such as the Trump campaign and European anti-immigrant move- ments, appeals to "the people" have primarily targeted white, native-born voters, by tapping into their grievances with demographic and cultural change, as well as their dissatisfaction with mainstream politics.[4] Nonetheless, such targeting strategies are often subtle and subsumed under ostensibly universal appeals to the public will._

_Besides its vilification of elites and glorification of the people, populism also entails a particular understanding of political institutions. Like most political strategies, populist appeals not only diagnose a political problem -- in this case, the elites' abandonment of the common good in favor of their own self-interest -- but also offer a solution, namely the acquisition of political power by the populist politician or party on behalf of the people. What complicates this simple political calculus, however, is populists' persistent delegitimization of democratic institutions. The moral suspicion cast on ostensibly corrupt elites, often extends to the institutions from which those elites profit, as evidenced by frequent references in populist discourse to rigged elections and the power of special interests. As a result, populism often calls for the replacement of existing intermediate political institutions with more direct forms of participation (e.g., referenda instead of legislative action by elected representatives).[5] This presents a legitimacy challenge for those populist actors who successfully gain entry into the same institutions they disparage._
