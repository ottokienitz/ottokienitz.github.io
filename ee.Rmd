Why study Eastern Europe?

*The East-West border is always wandering, sometimes eastward, sometimes west, and we do not know exactly where it is just now...* (Jaan Kaplinski, 1987)

Two German words: the hegemony of 'Mitteleuropa' versus the pluralism of 'Zwischeneuropa'

* Legacies of Empire
* Legacies of Communism
* Political Economy
* Democratization
* Democratic Backsliding
* Identity (nation, ethnicity, religion, language, etc.)
* Corruption
* Geopolitics (EU and Russia)
* Parties and populism
* Variation
