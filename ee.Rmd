Readings:

Wolchik and Curry, Part I: Introduction (Democracy, the Market, and the Return to Europe: From Communism to the European Union and NATO).

---

*The East-West border is always wandering, sometimes eastward, sometimes west, and we do not know exactly where it is just now...* (Jaan Kaplinski, 1987)

Geo-political framing and the ethno-national imagination (i.e. "historical mythology")

Two German words: the hegemony of 'Mitteleuropa' versus the pluralism of 'Zwischeneuropa'

Why study Eastern Europe?

* Legacies of Empire
* Legacies of Communism
* Political Economy
* Democratization
* Democratic Backsliding
* Identity (nation, ethnicity, religion, language, etc.)
* Corruption
* Geopolitics (EU and Russia)
* Parties and populism
* Variation

Questions:

1) What additional "groupings" can you draw among the countries of Eastern Europe? What other divisions exist within or between countries that were not already mentioned in lecture?
2) Someone mentioned the history of Catalonian independence today in lecture. Why might you be able to compare the history of Spain with the history of Eastern European states? What are some examples?
3) Why is there more heterogeneity or pluralism in terms of culture, politics, etc. in Eastern Europe compared to Western Europe? Is this true? Why or why not?

***) Challenge Question: list every country in Europe opposed to Kosovo's independence. What can this "simple" task tell us about the history and politics of (Eastern) Europe?

1) Often it is most difficult to explain large and complicated events in a few sentences or paragraphs. How would you answer the main question related to this week's readings i.e. what is state-socialism and how/why did it collapse?

2) What explains the variation among the different forms of state-socialism found in communist Eastern Europe?

3) Could the collapse of state-socialism have been avoided? Why or why not? What forces or contradictions undermined the system in (select country)?

***) Challenge Question: what is the difference(s) between communism and state-socialism as a political--economic idea? Where does one place Leninism on this ideological spectrum?
