**Readings:**

Wolchik and Curry, Part I: Introduction (Democracy, the Market, and the Return to Europe: From Communism to the European Union and NATO).

*The East-West border is always wandering, sometimes eastward, sometimes west, and we do not know exactly where it is just now...* (Jaan Kaplinski, 1987)

Geo-political framing and the ethno-national imagination (i.e. "historical mythology")

Two German words: the hegemony of 'Mitteleuropa' versus the pluralism of 'Zwischeneuropa'

Why study Eastern Europe?

* Legacies of Empire
* Legacies of Communism
* Political Economy
* Democratization
* Democratic Backsliding
* Identity (nation, ethnicity, religion, language, etc.)
* Corruption
* Geopolitics (EU and Russia)
* Parties and populism
* Variation

Questions:

1) What additional "groupings" can you draw among the countries of Eastern Europe? What other divisions exist within or between countries that were not already mentioned in lecture?
2) Someone mentioned the history of Catalonian independence today in lecture. Why might you be able to compare the history of Spain with the history of Eastern European states? What are some examples?
3) Why is there more heterogeneity or pluralism in terms of culture, politics, etc. in Eastern Europe compared to Western Europe? Is this true? Why or why not?

***) Challenge Question: list every country in Europe opposed to Kosovo's independence. What can this "simple" task tell us about the history and politics of (Eastern) Europe?

1) Often it is most difficult to explain large and complicated events in a few sentences or paragraphs. How would you answer the main question related to this week's readings i.e. what is state-socialism and how/why did it collapse?

2) What explains the variation among the different forms of state-socialism found in communist Eastern Europe?

3) Could the collapse of state-socialism have been avoided? Why or why not? What forces or contradictions undermined the system in (select country)?

***) Challenge Question: what is the difference(s) between communism and state-socialism as a political--economic idea? Where does one place Leninism on this ideological spectrum?

Adam Michnik: *There are two symbolic names for two different ways of thinking about what our attitude should be toward communists or people of the old regime. One is polemically called in Poland the "policy of the thick line" (polityka grubej kreski). [Former prime minister] Tadeusz Mazowiecki used this term in his first speech. He meant that a thick line should be drawn between the present and the past, and that competence and loyalty toward the new government should be the only criteria for evaluating public officials. He was then accused of wanting, by means of the policy of the thick line, to protect communists, criminals, thieves, and the like.*

*The other way originated in the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (CSFR), and is symbolized by the term "lustration" [verification or screening], These are two opposite ways of thinking about those issues. What do you think about the philosophy offered by Mazowiecki and the one offered by the supporters of lustration?*

What side of the debate do you support: justice or revenge?

*New* Read: [The State as a Firm: Understanding the Autocratic Roots of Technocratic Populism](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0888325418791723) by Lenka Buštíková and Petra Guasti

Abstract: *Why, when, and how does populism emerge in a stable democracy? This article investigates the political logic and ideological appeal of a rarely explored form of populism: technocratic populism. Technocratic populism uses the appeal of technical expertise to connect directly with the people, promising to run the state as a firm, while at the same time delegitimizing political opponents and demobilizing the electorate by instilling civic apathy. Technocratic populism is an anti-elite ideology that exploits competence to create the appearance of authenticity and proximity to ordinary people. It is less exclusionary than nativist or economic forms of populisms and its broad appeal is therefore arguably more threatening to representative democracy. In order to understand the appeal of technocratic populism, as well as why it arises at critical junctures when dominant ideologies are in turmoil, we argue that one must not ignore its historical roots, which shows that it transcends both regime changes and the traditional left–right divide. The article develops and examines these points using evidence from communist-era populist campaigns against “elitist” dissidents (from Charter 77) in the Czech Republic, and demonstrates how post-1989 politicians have exploited and also adapted ideas and strategies from the authoritarian past for the new democratic setting. The article highlights the adaptive character of technocratic populism across political regimes.*
