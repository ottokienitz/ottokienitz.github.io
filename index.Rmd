Otto Kienitz is a PhD student in Comparative Politics at the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests include the historical comparative study of democracy, democratization, and democratic institutions in post-Communist Europe and Eurasia with a particular focus on Russian politics; as well as the development and manipulation of electoral systems; contemporary regime dynamics; and the historical legacies of imperial democratization.

Prior to attending Berkeley, Otto received his B.A. (Phi Beta Kappa, Summa Cum Laude) in History with a Minor in Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania, and an M.A. in Russian and Eurasian Studies from the European University at St. Petersburg.
