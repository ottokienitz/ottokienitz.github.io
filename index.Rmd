<h5>PhD Candidate in Political Science, University of California, Berkeley</h5>

<br>

**Otto Kienitz** is a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley studying Comparative Politics.

His ***research interests*** include the study of democratic institutions in Europe and Eurasia with a particular focus on Russian politics; including local politics, public goods provision, and representation, historical legacies, and the historical political economy of the Russian Empire.

His ***dissertation*** studies the relationship between taxation and representation in autocracies, namely the interaction between local self-government and direct land taxation in the Russian, Ottoman, and Chinese empires. His other work explores historical comparative democratization with a focus on the role of the state, bureaucracy, and local self-government in Europe and the Americas.

He is the co-founder of the ***Historical Social Science Workshop (HSSW)*** and is an advocate for mixed-methods approaches to the study of historical political economy emerging from his training as a historian and experience with qualitative archival research in the context of the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom. He is a strong defender of the historian's craft and the importance of taking historiography seriously within the social sciences.

Prior to attending Berkeley, he received his B.A. (Phi Beta Kappa, Summa Cum Laude) in History with a Minor in Political Science from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu), and an M.A. in Russian and Eurasian Studies from the [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eu.spb.ru/en/) (Russia), and holds an M.A. in Political Science with Distinction from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu).

He enjoys music, futebol, and avant garde literature, and comes from a family of musicians, educators, and writers. His grandfather, Richard C. Kienitz, won a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 1967 for his reporting on water pollution in Wisconsin, "advancing... the national effort for the conservation of natural resources."
